# DataInteroperability
This repository contains scripts in various languages to generate interoperable data sets from high variety data sources. It is part of the effort of the Community of Practice on Socio-economic Data (CoP SED) of CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, to make messy socio-economic data more interoperable and reusable to accelerate and enhance the impact of international agricultural research for development.

## General design principles
The basic design principles
1. The code / scripts should be as generic as possible, ideally applicable to multiple data sets
2. Strict seperation between the three components driving data transformation:
    a. the data, 
    b. the data transformation scripts and 
    c. the switches with user settings, including but not limited to the link between data and scripts to use.
3. Scripts should be well documented to allow conversion into other languages and platforms when the need arises
4. New, converted or derived data sets should be accompanied with rich metadata, automatically generated by the scripts
5. Strict versioning of scripts, data and metadata


## Rationale and justification for the use of certain platforms and software solutions
### GAMS
GAMS is proprietary software focussed on mathematical programming. However it has some extremely powerful properties that make it very suitable for data management

    *set structure*


### AWK
