# DataInteroperability
Scripts in various languages to generate interoperable data sets from high variety data sources.

The basic design principles
1. The code / scripts should be as generic as possible, ideally applicable to multiple data sets
2. Strict seperation between the three components driving data transformation:
    a. the data, 
    b. the data transformation scripts and 
    c. the switches with user settings, including but not limited to the link between data and scripts to use.
3. Scripts should be well documented to allow conversion into other languages and platforms when the need arises
4. New, converted or derived data sets should be accompanied with rich metadata, automatically generated by the scripts
5. Strict versioning of scripts, data and metadata
